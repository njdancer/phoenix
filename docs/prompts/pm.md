## PM Prompt

This Project Brief provides the complete and comprehensive context for the project "Phoenix". All necessary details—including the project overview and purpose, key MVP objectives and success metrics, core MVP features, post-MVP ideas, technical constraints, architectural preferences, identified risks, and user preferences—are detailed in the preceding sections of this document.

Please initiate 'PM MODE 1'. Your primary task is to:

1.  Thoroughly review this entire Project Brief.
2.  Collaborate with the user to create the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
3.  Proceed section by section for the PRD, one at a time.
4.  Actively ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities.
5.  Suggest improvements or raise considerations based on your analysis of this brief, as your PM MODE 1 programming allows.

The detailed information previously summarized in the user's original PM prompt has been integrated into the main body of this brief, which serves as the definitive source material for PRD development.
